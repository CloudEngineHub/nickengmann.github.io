          <p class="lead">In 1776 our forefathers wrote this as the foundation of independence and freedom for not just themselves but for all individuals. At the beginning of our great nation these unalienable Rights were unfortunately limited to rich white men. But as we evolve as a nation we have begun to disperse these rights to more demographic groups.</p>

          <p class="lead">The protection of our individual freedoms is of the upmost importance to most Americans. In 1787 many patroits demanded the creation of the Bill of Rights in other to protect their individual rights and to limit government.</p>

          <p class="lead">It was written in 1789 when most of the delegates to the Constitutional convention felt it was necessary to articulate rights they believed to be inherent in the rights of mankind. Therefore, they chose to embody those rights into the Constitution by amending it to add the first 10 amendments. Thereafter, the constitution was amended at various other times.</p>

          <p class="lead">The Bill of Rights and the amendments to constitution have been referenced continually in many debates, court cases, and legislation in order to protect the rights of all legal citizens of the United States of America.</p>

          <p class="lead">McCarthyism is the practice of making accusations of subversion or treason without proper regard for evidence. It also means "the practice of making unfair allegations or using unfair investigative techniques, especially in order to restrict dissent or political criticism.</p>
          <p class="lead">In February 1950, appearing at the Ohio County Women's Republican Club in Wheeling, West Virginia, McCarthy gave a speech that propelled him into the national spotlight. Waving a piece of paper in the air, he declared that he had a list of 205 known members of the Communist Party who were "working and shaping policy" in the State Department. Despite a lack of any proof of subversion, more than 2,000 government employees lost their jobs as a result of McCarthy investigations"</p>

    <p class="lead">People equated the New Deal to being socialist/communist in nature and saw its policies as evidence that the government had been heavily influenced by Communist policy makers in the Roosevelt administration.</p>
    <p class="lead">Anti-Communist committees, panels, and loyalty review boards were established in order act out McCarthyism</p>
