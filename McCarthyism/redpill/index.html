          <p class="lead">In 1776 our forefathers wrote this as the foundation of independence and freedom for not just themselves but for all individuals. At the beginning of our great nation these unalienable Rights were unfortunately limited to rich white men.

          <p class="lead">It was written in 1789 when most of the delegates to the Constitutional convention felt it was necessary to articulate rights they believed to be inherent in the rights of mankind. Therefore, they chose to embody those rights into the Constitution by amending it to add the first 10 amendments. Thereafter, the constitution was amended at various other times.</p>

          <p class="lead">The Bill of Rights and the amendments to constitution have been referenced continually in many debates, court cases, and legislation in order to protect the rights of all legal citizens of the United States of America.</p>

It also means "the practice of making unfair allegations or using unfair investigative techniques, especially in order to restrict dissent or political criticism.</p>
          <p class="lead">In February 1950, appearing at the Ohio County Women's Republican Club in Wheeling, West Virginia, McCarthy gave a speech that propelled him into the national spotlight. Waving a piece of paper in the air, he declared that he had a list of 205 known members of the Communist Party who were "working and shaping policy" in the State Department. Despite a lack of any proof of subversion, more than 2,000 government employees lost their jobs as a result of McCarthy investigations"</p>

Donald Trump's wants to place a tempoary ban on Muslim's from entering the United States of America. By placing this tempoary blockage he is preventing thousands of individuals from getting the opportunity to immigrate to a safe location. This strategy demonizes Muslims and instills a sense of fear within the public concerning Muslims. This sort of attitude will only promote more violence and aggression between people.</p>

           <p>Trump also has a plan to deport millions of Mexicans who have immigrated into the United States because they are "theives and rapists". Many of the immigrants that have come into this country have obtained jobs and are working hard to support themselves and the American economy. Donald Trump's <a href="javascript:setVisibility('sub6', inline');">wall</a> idea also imprints fear within the public and promotes hostility between Mexico and the United States.</p>
